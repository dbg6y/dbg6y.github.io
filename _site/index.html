      <h1>About</h1>
<p>
  I am an Assistant Professor in the
  <a href="https://www.fmarion.edu/biology/ " target="_blank">Biology Department</a> at Francis Marion University in Florence, South Carolina.
  Since joining the department in Fall 2023 I've taught
  <a href="/assets/ENVR101_S2025_Syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to Environmental Science</a>,
  <a href="/assets/ENVR102_S2024_Syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to Sustainability</a>,
  <a href="/assets/ENVR201_F2024_Syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">Water Quality & Water Resources Management</a>, and
  <a href="/assets/ENVR215_S2025_Syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to Mapping and GIS</a>.
  Prior to that, I was a postdoc at the University of Maryland, where I managed
  <a href="https://dawn.umd.edu/" target="_blank">DAWN</a>, a USDA-funded project to build a decision-support dashboard for US farmers.
</p> 
<p>
  My research blends environmental science with modern data tools to understand landscape evolution, identify vulnerable ecosystems,
  and support sustainable agricultural production. Most recently, I've been using drone imagery and machine learning algorithms to assess
  the health of Carolina Bay ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  Before joining adademia, I was a
  <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank">Peace Corps</a> volunteer in Burkina Faso and a program manager in the Middle East section
  at the US Forest Service
  <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/international-programs" target="_blank">Office of International Programs</a>.
  Although I've had to cut back on travel after my kids were born, I still maintain a strong interest in international development
  and cross-border environmental protection efforts.
