## About Me
I hold a Ph.D. in Civil & Environmental Engineering from Princeton University and currently serve as an Assistant Professor at Francis Marion University. My work blends environmental science with modern data tools to understand complex systems, forecast resource availability, and support decision-making under uncertainty.

**Specialties:**
- Geospatial modeling (GIS, remote sensing)
- Machine learning for environmental data
- Hydrologic & agricultural systems
- Data visualization and web dashboards
