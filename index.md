## About Me
I hold a Ph.D. in Civil & Environmental Engineering from Princeton University and currently serve as an Assistant Professor at Francis Marion University. My work blends environmental science with modern data tools to understand complex systems, forecast resource availability, and support decision-making under uncertainty.

**Specialties:**
- Geospatial modeling (GIS, remote sensing)
- Machine learning for environmental data
- Hydrologic & agricultural systems
- Data visualization and web dashboards

## Projects
### 🌾 DAWN Dashboard
**A predictive decision support system for agricultural water and nutrient management**  
Built as part of a $5M USDA-funded initiative, DAWN helps farmers and water managers respond to climate variability with smarter decisions.  
**Technologies:** Python, climate models

### 📍 Mapping Smallholder Agriculture in Africa
Used satellite imagery and crowd-sourced data to map cropping patterns and irrigation infrastructure across Sub-Saharan Africa.  
**Technologies:** R, Python, QGIS, SQL

### 💧 Ecohydrologic Modeling in Kenya
Developed simulation models to assess the resilience of smallholder irrigation systems in dryland environments.  
**Technologies:** Python, LaTeX, AWS, environmental sensors
