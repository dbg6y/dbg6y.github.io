## About
I am an Assistant Professor in the Biology Department at Francis Marion University in Florence, South Carolina. Since joining the department in Fall 2023 I've taught Introduction to Environmental Science, Introduction to Sustainability, Water Quality & Water Resources Management, and Introduction to Mapping and GIS.

My work blends environmental science with modern data tools to understand landscape evolution, identify vulnerable ecosystems, and support sustainable agricultural production. 

Before joining adademia, I was a [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteer in Burkina Faso and a program manager in the Middle East section at the US Forest Service [Office of International Programs](https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/international-programs).
